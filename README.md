this was a bot created for a programming competition https://playground.riddles.io/competitions/light-riders

it ended up placing in somewhere are #80 out of like >200. I originally wanted to actually go for first, but due to school and work I didnt have time to put much more work into this

The bot started out as a 'starter bot'. so much of the basic implementation was already done. most of my code was in Bot.cpp and Board.cpp
